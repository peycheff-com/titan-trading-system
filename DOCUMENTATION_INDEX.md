## 5. Truth Gaps & Implementation Status

Items documented but not fully visible in code, or code features missing docs:

- **Experimental**: `titan-powerlaw-lab` is present but marked experimental.
- **Observability**: Tracing is implemented in Rust (OpenTelemetry) but docs mainly focus on Prometheus.
